# Real-Time ORB-SLAM3 Navigation System with Person Intelligence

## Abstract

This repository presents a comprehensive real-time indoor navigation system that integrates ORB-SLAM3 Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) with artificial intelligence-powered person detection and recognition capabilities. The system addresses fundamental limitations in existing SLAM-based navigation systems while providing advanced spatial intelligence for accessibility applications.

## Technical Overview

The system combines Visual SLAM technology with machine learning-based person detection to create a dual-intelligence navigation platform. Key contributions include solving ORB-SLAM3's 180-degree rotation tracking failure through novel backwards walking navigation algorithms and implementing real-time AI-SLAM data fusion for persistent spatial memory creation.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

**Navigation Subsystem**: Enhanced ORB-SLAM3 implementation featuring universal PathGuide integration, path optimization algorithms, and cross-platform audio guidance systems.

**Person Intelligence Subsystem**: Modular Python-based AI detection system utilizing YOLOv10m for real-time person detection, face recognition with persistent database storage, and automated 3D landmark generation.

**Integration Layer**: JSON-based communication bridge enabling real-time data exchange between C++ SLAM processing and Python AI detection systems.

**Cross-Platform Framework**: Universal build system supporting Windows, Linux, and macOS deployments with platform-specific optimizations.

## Key Innovations

### Backwards Walking Navigation Algorithm
Novel solution addressing ORB-SLAM3's fundamental limitation where 180-degree camera rotations cause complete tracking loss and map reset. The algorithm maintains visual feature consistency through backwards locomotion while providing reversed navigation instructions.

### Temporal MapPoint Accumulation
Advanced 3D positioning system that accumulates SLAM MapPoints over 2-second intervals when persons remain stationary, enabling centimeter-level accuracy in 3D landmark placement through mathematical coordinate transformation.
